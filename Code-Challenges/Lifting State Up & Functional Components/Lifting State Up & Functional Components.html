<div id="root"></div>

  By now, you have learned about different component types, including function components and class components. In the JS section of this Codepen is an example of a class component named Welcome. 
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Challenge 1:</strong> Inside the JS section, create a class component named <strong>App</strong>. Inside its render() method, have it return the <strong>Welcome</strong> component. In the <strong>ReactDOM.render()</strong> method, change Welcome to App. 
</>
<p>
  <strong>Challenge 2:</strong> Lift the <strong>state</strong> from the Welcome component to App, so that the state is initialized inside of App's constructor. 
<p>
  <strong>Challenge 3:</strong> Convert the Welcome component to a <strong>function component</strong> that returns the same welcome message as before. You will need to pass the <strong>bootcampName</strong> property of state from App to the Welcome component. It's up to you whether or not to destructure it -- either is fine. Try it both ways for practice!
